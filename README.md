# Obsidian-Lite â€” A Local-Only Markdown Notes App

This is a minimalist, Obsidian-inspired note-taking app that runs entirely in your browser. Write in Markdown, use `[[backlinks]]` to link notes together, and everything stays private on your device.

**Live demo:** [jdhunterae.github.io/obsidian-lite](https://jdhunterae.github.io/obsidian-lite)

## Data & Privacy Notice

All notes are stored **only in your browser** using `localStorage`.

- No notes are ever sent to a server.
- If you clear your browser data or switch devices, your notes will be lost unless exported manually.
- This means your notes are private, secure, and offline by design.
- Backup regularly if you're writing anything important!
